/* A lot of the environment variables are stored in the Registry. This means you can query them using the reg command */

reg query "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment"
	These variables are common to all users

reg query HKCU\Environment
reg query "HKCU\Volatile Environment"
	Above two are specific to current user session


setx variable value
	permanently set your own environment variable. It is stored in the registry but not made immediately available
reg query "HKCU\Environment"

set variable=value
	the variable is available immediately but is not stored in the registry. 
	You cannot use the reg command to list them although they are shown by set. 
	These temporary environment variables do not persist after you end the command-prompt session.
	

/*
Dynamic Variables are internal variables of cmd.exe. 
So these variables are available only in a Windows command prompt window which is a running cmd.exe process 
or a batch file processed by cmd.exe. The dynamic variables are not available in other executables or scripts 
as these variables are not environment variables.

The most common used dynamic variables are:

CD
	The current directory path not ending with a backlash, except the current directory is the root directory of the drive.
DATE
	The current local date in format as defined for the account in region and language settings of Windows.
TIME
	The current local time in format as defined for the account in region and language settings of Windows.
ERRORLEVEL
	Exit value of previously executed command or program.
RANDOM
	A random decimal number between 0 and 32767.
